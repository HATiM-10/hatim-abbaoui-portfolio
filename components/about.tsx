              I'm a third-year Electronics & Robotics student at Mohammed V University, driven by a passion for
              industrial engineering and process optimization. My academic projects and robotics competitions have
              refined my skills in embedded programming, system integration, and analytical problem-solving.

              At Lear Corporation, I'm gaining hands-on experience in Measurement System Analysis (MSA) & Statistical
              Process Control (SPC) while developing Python workflows to automate data validation and reporting.
              Certified Six Sigma White Belt, I apply DMAIC methodologies to enhance operational efficiency and am eager
              to tackle real-world industrial challenges.
